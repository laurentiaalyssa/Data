0x840;A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.

It's not like image processing or something, where you just write down the math and then anybody can run the computation on publicly available datasets, or a DNA sequence or a protein folding result. It's a pile of numbers that only make sense if you believe what is said about the apparatus.\n\nI completely agree that Dias does not look good when he gives crappy justifications for not sharing data.

0x10b9;I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.

0x6a8;"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected."

0xb94;I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century. And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there. I wonder sometimes if articles like this aren't mostly posted by the paid corporate trolls of the carbon producing energy companies. I just read an excellent how to on subverting social media, this would definitely qualify.

0xfa6;A PhD is not the same kind of struggle as a BS program. There is a completely different level of self-reliance and drive that is required to get through a research project where you are more or less completely responsible for the outcome. Often thereâ€™s nothing that can you can look up or read that will give you the answer to your specific problem (otherwise it wouldnâ€™t be research). 90% of the work you do may yield negative results, and you have to be ok with coming into work everyday and â€œfailingâ€ despite your best efforts, and as others have said, even enjoy the process.\n\nI would definitely recommend trying to get hired as an undergrad researcher in one of the groups in your department. Itâ€™s really the only way to know for sure if you would enjoy that kind of work. It can be incredibly rewarding if you are ok with the grind.

0xd7e;Iâ€™m struggling to understand what you mean
0x235a;"Hereâ€™s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\nâ€œâ€œ>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesnâ€™t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. â€œ\n\n[End of your quote. If you donâ€™t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but thereâ€™s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that Iâ€™ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we donâ€™t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point Iâ€™ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what Iâ€™m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). Itâ€™s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that youâ€™re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that Iâ€™ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\nâ€œ>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldnâ€™t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.â€\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said â€œ[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldnâ€™t be feasible no matter how efficient it gotâ€ and then you tell me to â€œshut upâ€ for saying that you said that â€œDAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.â€ Iâ€™m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, Iâ€™m this part where you quoted me Iâ€™m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said â€œcouldnâ€™t be feasibleâ€ this was meant to be synonymous with â€œimpossibleâ€ rather than â€œunfeasible,â€ then either youâ€™ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and Iâ€™m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldnâ€™t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you."

0x152;Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.  Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology. As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question.

The paper reported sharp drops in the measured magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for five different pressures, that were claimed to be a superior test signaling a superconducting transition. Here I present several arguments indicating that the susceptibility data published in that paper were probably fraudulent. This calls into question the validity of the entire paper and its claim of detection of room temperature superconductivity. I also describe the roadblocks that I have encountered in reaching this conclusion. A variety of implications of this situation are discussed.

0x1e0a;Matter is more like a particle then light. They tried describing light as a wave. That failed.

The wave only models have been tried and they failed.\n\n\n  â€œIt is however tempting to argue that the\nconceptual underpinnings of the quantum theory of radiation and the concept of a photon can be best thought of as involving a classical electromagnetic field plus the fluctuations associated with vacuum.\nHowever, advances in quantum optics have brought forward new arguments for quantizing the electromagnetic field, and with them deeper insight into the conceptual nature of photons. With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.â€\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20

0xc12;Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.

0x1d64;"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory."

0xd68;"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.

Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway. In this case there is no need for the power budget to match.

0x1e68;What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection

0x4da;Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management. Hours will depend on the company culture - some of my US colleagues work quite long days, but on the whole it's likely to be less hours than a PhD.

0xe51;"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies."

0x4bc;Not the same molecules I'm working with but no other functional groups present should have any interference. I found two methods for selectively protecting a phenol in the presence of a primary alcohol - one with trityl (very difficult product to isolate and low yield) and one method doing a very similar transformation protecting with ethyl carbonate, mesylating the primary OH and reacting with DEA to add the amine and deprotect in one step. Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping. Maybe the DEA would be reactive enough on its own without additional base to promote substitution instead of elimination? Not sure.

Not sure if the other publishers have something similar. Definitely nothing for all publishers in one place.\n\nIf you want to keep up with literature I suggest making a google scholar account and add alerts. However, Google scholar is also pretty good on it's own proposing relevant papers once it has more information about you. Research gate does something similar.\n\nScifinder alerts are another possibility to keep up for example if you are interested in certain reactions or structures.\n\nTwitter is also a really good place.

0x1301;Also non-physicist here.  From what little I can understand about this phenomenon (time asymmetry), it's like when neutrino and muon neutrino (or was it electron and muon, or even other particles, I cannot remember the exact details) can transform to one another but it takes X time to transform from one to the other while it takes Y time to transform the other way.  Then reversing the time,  you find that the transformation time is swapped.\n\nMore concretely, let A to B transformation takes X time but B to A transformation takes Y time when played forward in time.  Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.  The overall system has to preserve CPT-symmetry.  In this case, when playing it backward in time, you do not reverse either the charge (C) or the parity (P).

That's why Australia has one of the highest percentages of skin cancer in the world.

A lighter skin is therefore an adaptation to less sunlight in higher latitudes : with lighter skin, you absorb more sunlight and thus produce more vitamin D. That's why black people often lack vitamin D in North america and northern Europe, and often have to take supplements.

0x1ff8;My guess is that it's not that the pea was sucked in, the pea was pushed in. High pressure systems move to low pressure systems. By heating the soup, you create a high pressure system. The air inside the noodle is insulated by the pasta maintaining a slightly lower pressure system than outside the noodle. The pressure outside rushed in the noodle, taking with it things in the soup that fit inside the noodle. Peas were then pushed inside the noodle by the high pressure soup system

0x23f5;"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!"

0x23e0;I mean the easiest answer is that there are less because you donâ€™t need as many.\n\nRed blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Most importantly to your brain but also to all your other organs as well as your muscles. All of these tissues use up oxygen very very quickly. If you have a dip in your red blood cell count you will feel very faint and will die from it if it goes low enough.\n\nWhite blood cells are needed in much fewer number. They are also able to talk to eachother and travel specifically to where they are needed. If you get too many of them, it can actually cause problems.

0x1d80;It doesn't matter whether you've got your hands on the handlebars or not. The downward force acting on the bike should be centred at the wheels because otherwise it will pull one side down and the whole bike will fall. Under normal circumstances, the bike will stand up right. As soon as other factors are added such as wind or a weight, the bike will be pulled down and the wheels cannot compensate for this entirely. A component of the force will pull the bike to the direction of the force. In order to not fall down, you will angle the bike such that this component is zero again, thereby moving the bike in the opposite direction. You will always balance the bike, it's just that with an extra force to the left side you need to balance by moving the force from the weight to the right hand side.

0x91a;Keep in mind, also, that except for the dz2 orbital, all the other orbitals are linear combinations of the wavefunctions that are proper solutions of the Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics.  It's just that when the m-sub-el quantum number is nonzero, the wavefunction includes an imaginary exponential as one part.  Because some folks are uncomfortable with imaginary numbers, chemists routinely use linear combinations that cancel out the imaginary parts to give functions that are real (i.e. contain no square-root-of-minus-one parts).

0x1f12;"I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)"

0x10a4;For starters, by this atomic clock experiment we have a link between the precision of quantum theory/experiment with that of GR.\n\nEvidently we can detect minute changes across a millemeter in these modern atomic clocks' optical frequency, known to one part in now nearly 20. Frequency is the most precise unit we can presently measure, so running out of experimental digits to agree with might not be the issue in this case.\n\nSince gravitation is responsible for this altered timing, GR can make a prediction for this alteration, and indeed according to the article apparently it does so well. However, it doesn't say to what precision the calculation is, though presumably it's tight enough to resolve the miniscule redshift...so possibly this is amongst the most accurate tests? I'm not too familiar with benchmarks of GR.

0x244;There's a couple of characteristics of a good catalyst IMO.\n\nSelectivity is one. Meaning it does the desired transformation 99% of the time or more. Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.

If your partially informed friend is concerned about the biology of the mRNA vaccines suggest the adenovirus vector based product.\nFor all the hand waving, smoke and mirrors in healthcare the honest truth is the biggest impacts on population health and longevity come from managing vaccine preventable illness and indoor plumbing.\nGet the shot, or donâ€™t. But make the choice based on good science, not feelings and Facebook. But remember, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The risk of re-infection from SARS COV-2 is real, the risk of death is very real, and not small. Death from respiratory failure is not a good death. Choose wisely.

0x1745;"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today â€” these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics â€” or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people â€” humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension â€” are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.  And it seems to me that idea extends to natural law as much as it extends to the ""content"" of nature (matter, and how the world/cosmos is arranged, etc.).\n\nThoughts?  Cheers,"

0x25cd;...yeah, there's two things here that other people are either saying or dancing around:\n\n1.

Also, since they have a product which captures carbon, people won't need to stop polluting.  This is just kicking the can down the road and allowing a literally extremely toxic system to continue existing.\n\n2.  There's an easier way out of this, but the solution is _political_, not technological.  It's really, really not hard to imagine a society where endless increasing production is not the _necessity_ to keep the 'economy' going.  This just requires completely retooling our political & economic system, since they are essentially the same thing at the moment.  Because if you could have actual democratic decision making, not like the system we have to day which has the veneer of democracy but really only serves the powerful, then you could make decisions that have large-scale impacts on things like infrastructure/emissions/people's daily lives.  \n\nThose being said, yeah, any tech that could potentially help avert a climate disaster is good, even if it's being built just to make money.  I just want to see a world where science & engineering are done to advance humanity, not to advance profits.

0x1d4e;*All* food proteins, with the exception of gelatin from rendered animal collagen, contain *all* of the essential amino acids. \n\nWhat differs is whether their proportions match requirements for human protein synthesis. Cereal grains tend to be limited in lysine. Legumes tend to be limited in methionine. One can still get a complete essential amino acid intake by eating enough of either, but combining these as part of daily menus mean that not much additional protein intake beyond the minimums is required.\n\nSoy is notable for being the legume with the highest methionine content. It's not a huge difference. Peas are methionine limited and have a DIAAS of around 80. Soy is methionine limited and has a DIAAS around 100. Eat 40 grams of soy protein, or 50 grams of pea protein, and you're getting the same amount of the limiting essential amino acid.

Applying a specific voltage to each pixel you can vary the value of the circular birefringence of the medium and locally modify the phase and intensity of the output wavefront.

0x175c;Source: I work in a warehouse with lots of cardboard and rigid foam paneling, and when a 1x1meter foam panel lays down, you can kick it horizontally and it will often spontaneously rise up, create this air cushion, and glide silently along the floor for an impressively long distance. \n\nKicking the plate off-center helps it go further. you give the plate a spin, helping to keep it horizontal like a frisbee, and now itâ€™s more resilient to nose-diving into the floor.

0x16d6;As a chemistry the advice I always give in my office hours is to solve equation based problems in the reverse of how the solutions are shown in class.\n\nStart by figuring out what the question is asking for as the answer. Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for. This makes it much much easier for someone grading to follow what you did.

Level question that would suffice.\n\nA little more depth though...PSI can actually be activated by light in the far-red wavelengths which exist in natural sunlight. The movement of electrons and breaking of water molecules across the electron transport chain is actually useful in a number of different activities such as ATP production, dissipating and storing solar energy to prevent damage (this is a main feature of photosystems, turning energy into sugars and starches by powering the calvin cycle). ATP is produced as a product through excess hydrogen from spiltting water being pushed out of the membrane through a concentration gradiant to produce ATP using ATP synthase. \n\nYour question is answered in the first section, but I could go on and on about the electron transport chain.

I'm live a very healthy life style and have no health issues, but came down the the recent flu despite not being sick for years. I even had the flu shot few weeks ago. I have a sore throat but no other issues...really wish i didn't even have a sore throat.\n\n>Since mrna vaccines transport the mrna via nanolipid particles they can possibly enter every cell of the Human Body and everyone is dependent of the one giving the Shot (hitting muscle =ok, hitting Arteries the mrna goes around everywhere and may settle in your brain or heart Cells causing severe damage)\n\nNo. The mRNA will not ""settle in your brain or heart cells causing damage"". The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\n>He Heard the immune response to â€šnormalâ€˜ infections like Common colds gets messed up and in General the complete immune System may gets erroreus and doesnt work properly as it does now (in our clique/Family/ Friends many have cough/Common cold Right now me included \[all vaccinated\] while he is totally fine and he sees This as a confirmstion of his believe)\n\nThere's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\n\n>He acknowledges that mrna vaccines are Not new but questiones why all other previous tries to develop/release a mrna vaccine couldnt get past phase3 studies..\n\nThat was a surprise for me too. But the endpoints and outcomes of the protocol were approved and the trial results met the efficacy and safety standards. None of which were altered because of COVID. These are done by independent review boards and have to declare no conflicts of interest. There has also been failed mRNA COVID vaccines too, but that's less in the news.

0x17a4;Keep the resume short, targeted and relevant.\n\nRealistically at your skill level it's going to be max 2 pages in length.  First guess for omitting skills for you will simple be keeping the length on paper short.\n\nIf the job is > 5 years ago it's probably not relevant.  Your current skills will be just so much more valuable.  90% of the time that is all I'm reading and the remainder is filler content.  YMMV.\n\nYour PhD experience will be the majority at maybe 1/2 - 2/3 page in length of both bullet points and short 3 line length project summaries.  The PhD experience is so huge that you can realistically omit all other job history and nobody will say anything.\n\nShould you feel you must include it or show a longer working period, a customer service job is maybe just 1-2 lines of year/location/title.  Different if are specifically targeting a job in customer service + chemical industry.  A chemical sales job I'd go 3-5 lines because working for a chemical company is relevant, especially the product, type of chemistry, size of team, your ops budget and any successes.  I do have jobs where I want to see evidence the chemist has a broad knowledge of supplier networks, but I also have jobs where I would ignore that skill.\n\nAnother aim is to remove any *negatives* from a resume.  If they job doesn't require customer service experience, remove it.  Maybe you worked at Dominos and the hiring manager hates that company for some random reason.  That may be enough to trash the application.

0x1961;I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-airâ€™s volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plateâ€™s downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the airâ€™s acceleration along the escape path. The airâ€™s inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plateâ€™s downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now itâ€™s on a more pronounced â€œair cushionâ€ but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the airâ€™s pressure to remain high. Now that the plateâ€™s weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it â€œslides downhillâ€ on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plateâ€™s slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.

Advertisements and postings are often made because it's company policy or required by statute, as with many government jobs. \n\nI would suggest going to people you know in the business, such as the professors and even the post-docs in your former university. They may be able to put you in touch with people who can help or who might have openings available. If there's a placement service in your alma mater, talk to them, too. \n\nI'd recommend searching old posts here and in /r/labrats for job hunting advice. \n\nI've hired a lot of people during my career. It may help to know how the hiring process goes in institutions of any size, for example, a company or a national lab. \n\n1. When a position comes available, they haul out a stack of accumulated resumes or applications, starting with anywhere from 100 to 300. Someone in HR leafs through them, discarding most for real or arbitrary reasons, eg, messy, bad grammar, soaked with perfume, totally off topic, weird fonts. This is why it's important to tailor you resume to each job you apply for (not the same as lying, just making the best presentation). \n2. When the stack is whittled down to 20 or so, it's sent to the hiring authority, usually your future boss. S/he will try to whittle the stack down to 5 or 6, and arrange them in some order of priority. \n3. The top 2 or 3 will enter the interview process. In my experience, the top candidates are often already employed by the time I saw at their applications, so I work down the stack until I get a manageable number of interviewees. \n4. If no suitable candidate is available, then they advertise the job and restart the process. \n\nOther places handle it differently, reaching out to their network of colleagues to find promising students or recent graduates. Then we contacted them and ask them to apply.

Maybe if you preloaded the injection site with a translation inhibitor you could prevent it (at the cost of some severe side effects). An antisense vaccine administered immediately to the same site may reduce the total mRNA that gets translated but it won't prevent it entirely. Loading up on immunosuppressants may prevent immunity developing but the mRNA would still be translated.

Only states that have been observes so far are colourless ones, as far as I know, but the search is still ongoing.\n\nThe colour charge is a property of a symmetry group: SU(3) Weyl group, I believe. So you can swap the ""colour label"" between particles/quarks and the system is invariant. This is the essence of symmetry.\n\nEdit:\nI took a quick glimpse at the QCD Lagrangian, and I think that two quarks with equal colour state experience a different interaction than two quarks with different colours. It is evident in the structure constants (which are anti-symmetric). You can also imagine that since they are fermions, quarks will behave differently when their states are similar/equal."

0xbec;The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a Âµg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-Âµg scales. Even the recent Es paper relied on a single spectroscopy that has an exceptionally low detection limit (XAS) rather than the traditional inorganic chemistry tool of SC-XRD, which requires a single crystal, typically of 10Âµg or more total mass.

0x4be;"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect."

0xfe6;"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer. Maybe your super man will be as swole as a gorilla, but he's going to look like a Hapsburg."

0x222d;No, it does not take a long time to obtain an accurate energy measurement. Longer duration does not necessarily imply greater uncertainty in time measurements.

0x1d7c;Actually, u/Adventurous_Yam_2852 is correct. Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos

0x74c;I mean, you could always make your own standard. If you're confident you have extremely high purity salt to begin with (KCl for example), you would need a very precise mass of salt and a very accurate volume/mass of 18.2 MO water (pretty common in echem labs).\n\nIt's all about how confident you are about the [Cl-] in your solution. Also about how confident you are that there isn't anything else in solution that behaves like Cl- (IIRC F- can interfere with chloride ISEs, don't quote me on that though).\n\nSo ultimately, if you can make it yourself and are confident in the purity of KCl / DI water you're using, I don't see why not. Bear in mind you'll probably have to re-make the standard (the shelf life won't be great) between experiments depending on usage.\n\nDefinitely calculate and propagate the error if you serial dilute to make a calibration curve.\n\nIMO it depends on whether you need the certifications that come with buying the standards / what kind of experiment you want to perform.

0x7b;Idk but I know the matter type plasma
0xd12;Think about the forces in play. You have a constant air resistance force applying itself horizontally to the rope. You have tension in the rope that is not constant. If we pick two points on the rope and imagine the tension we see the tension is much higher at the top as the rope is holding the mass of all the rope beneath it. If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less. Again, if we look at the forces applied to a single point on the rope we can see at the top the tension vector is very long in the negative direction in comparison to the horizontal force of the wind. The sum of those vectors faces almost completely down. As we continue to do so further down the rope we see the tension decreases and the ratio of that tension vector in comparison to the horizontal air force vector decreases and the total force vector points more in the direction of the horizontal force.

0xe60;The inverse relationship is the key: the less uncertainty in one variable, the higher the uncertainty in the other.Â \n\n  \nSo, the more accurate your time measures are, the less accurate your energy measures are.Â   \nAnd the more accurate the energy values you get, the more uncertain your time measurements are.\n\nThe interpretation you describe is more restrictive.

0x2367;"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week."

Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\n>If, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment. We probably didnt have emotions, didnt move, were giants, like towers, and I dont even know if we did procreate).\n\nAnd I even claim that our pre ancestor side is regenerating with time, this is why we dont look like animals anymore and became more rational.\n\n\nTaxonomy is a actually something much more complicated, in some cases, like us, you have to show the multiple Nature while maybe at the same time showing their percentages, it should be something like chemistry, where the nomenclatures are all complex and sophisticated."

0x17f0;"IMO-->  Empathy is a multi-faceted problem.  I would relate it to the kind of computational power required to simulate our universe, with all of it's constantly changing and simultaneously interacting variables.  The more accurately you can create someone else's world in your mind, the deeper your empathetic understanding will be.  It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.  Or you can imagine choosing the most efficient route for a package in a large shipping company, with all of it's ever moving planes, trains, trucks, personnel, etc.  The variables are constantly changing, therefore, the package's route is ever changing.\nThis would be different, however, than someone who memorized fixed mathematical rules to solve a complex linear or singular type equation.  Therefore, if a multi-faceted intelligence is valued over a more focused linear type intelligence, then yes, it would require more intelligence to produce higher quality empathetic understandings.  But that opens another can of worms.  What type of intelligence = high intelligence.  A well rounded ""jack of all trades,"" or a proficient ""one trick pony?""  They both have their place, and one is not necessarily better than the other."

0x1339;Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.

It would be tantamount to inbreeding.

To grow a large bismuth hopper like this, you want to hit a sweet spot of crystallization speed so that your crystal is hefty but still has that distinctive growth pattern. In my experience, the trick is to have a big crucible of molten bismuth just above the melting point, and to use a seed crystal to dredge a big chunk of bismuth from the center of the melt before the entire thing has a chance to freeze solid.\n\nFun fact about bulk bismuth: it is one of few materials for which the solid phase is less dense than the liquid (like water).

0x217e;There's not really an answer to this question in the movie either. If I recall correctly they provide oxygen masks for inverted humans since you cannot breathe regular oxygen if you are inverted, and the protagonist gets hypothermia due to exposure to fire while inverted - suggesting you have a strange interaction with non-inverted matter while you yourself are inverted (and probably vice-versa?). You cannot drop an inverted bullet, but you can pick it up as it undoes being dropped at a later point in your timeline.\n\nBut then indeed, it should also mean that you cannot see uninverted light while you are inverted, but how would it work if say, the sun shines on an inverted object, how does non-inverted light reflect off of inverted surfaces? From the object's point of view, something happened that caused him to emit sunlight back at the sun, meaning you can calculate what light it must have shone onto it that caused it to emit sunlight (sunlight + what it should absorb). Therefore, shining regular light onto an inverted object causes it to emit... *more light*?

0x1075;A small part of it has to do with gyroscopic procession, which takes a lot of explanation to understand, but the main force behind a football's stability is that it rotates around its axis of minumum inertia. \n\nTake your phone, and spin it in the air around its long axis. This is the exact same physical state as the football. The mass of the ball is distributed closest to the axis, so it is least likely to deviate from a spin.\n\nIf any force were to cause it to wobble, it would want to return to its its smallest moment of inertia at first, and this would be guarded by gyroscopic procession, which causes all movement parallel to the axis of rotation to occur processed 90 degrees forward along the direction of rotation. Any outside force, instead of spinning the ball, would just cause it to wobble.\n\nI hope this helps.

0x144a;"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone ðŸŽƒ"

0x173d;I'm not sure what would happen (engineer, not physicist), but i think you'd basicly be using 'all of space' as your energy source. At t=0+, when the valve is opened, the water is pulled up, but that force actually acts both ways, trying to equalize the pressure, and thus 'pulling' on the space end of the tube. This makes sense because space is not a 100% true vacuum, there are still some particles, but they are so sparse that the pressure is effectively 0.  Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up. Moving the water just ends up being infinitely easier, and thus the outcome that ends up occuring.

Certain correction mutations would leave almost no trace such as correcting a single misspelling that causes a disease.

For example if someone were using CRISPR-Cas to express a novel gene product in human it would. There the fact that the new gene is where it shouldn't be that can tell you. Additionally it would be surrounded by genetic neighbors that would help turn it on. Some of the popular helping neighbor genetic element(promoters, enhancers, ext)) don't come from humans.

I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US.

I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- itâ€™s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, Iâ€™m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing Iâ€™ll say is that unlike in school, where youâ€™re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  Itâ€™s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, itâ€™s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out itâ€™s not working to figuring out why itâ€™s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, thereâ€™s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesnâ€™t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.  Thereâ€™s no feedback loop- you just use the rules you learned to approach and solve the problem they give you.\n\nEither way, good luck!

0x135b;Let him chill in your garden heâ€™s getting ready to pass.
0x1022;This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water donâ€™t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried â€œsalt bridgesâ€ where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to â€œbendâ€ the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains â€œzip upâ€ very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess thatâ€™s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb Iâ€™ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacherâ€™s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.

So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos

I don't think it's unreasonable to think the Buddhists got a lot of things right, or that psychedelics offer an incredible opportunity to learn how consciousness operates. There's plenty of research from a variety of academic fields that supports claims of this sort.\n\nNeuroscientists, (bio)physicists, and mathematicians can get along well enough to create a healthy discursive space, but when you add philosophers (or even worse, psychonauts...or the worst: psychonaut philosophers) into the mix, the company grows cold.

Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.

The city I live in has three MPIs. I donâ€™t work at one of those, but I do a PhD in physics in a similar institute. One of the other PhDs in my group did his master in the MPI on the other side of the road. He says working there was nice, but you need a proper work ethic (which you need anyway for a PhD). \nIn general, before starting a PhD you should find out who your direct supervisor is and who the professor youâ€™re going to work under is. From my experience thatâ€™s often not the same person in the bigger institutes. So itâ€™s good to make sure you can work with both of them. I would also recommend that you only start a PhD in a topic that really, really fascinates and intrigues you. Donâ€™t start a PhD in something that has good job prospects but that doesnâ€™t interest you.

0x17f1;"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good."

0x269f;So the glucose we get from gluconeogenesis and eating food will be exactly the same in structure, however the function of the glucose at any point in time might differ to suit the bodyâ€™s current needs. Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel. (Hungry)\n\nIf hungry â€”> glucose is broken down for energy\n\nIf not hungry â€”> glucose is converted to fuel-storage molecules.\n\n\nEXPLANATION: \n\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving, your body is not short of energy, so the food you eat wonâ€™t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted (itâ€™s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point). Instead, the body converts the glucose into fuel-storage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source.\n\nHowever, when you are starving, your body is low on glucose. The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival, so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case, we are starving and need fuel to survive. So instead, the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body.

0x17e4;"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

0x1456;Do I need a minor in computer science to demonstrate competence? \n \nI'm an undergraduate and a self taught coder. Python, C++ and AutoHotKey, if that counts.

I'm still improving, and by the time I graduate (~2 years) I should have plenty of ability.\n \nI don't think that getting a CS minor is an option for me, at least not without postponing graduation for a bit.

0x2644;As someone else mentioned, yeah, it's the weak interaction that's weird in this way, not neutrinos. And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.

And even the standard clocks in different national laboratories are not in exactly the same gravitational potential. Therefore for realization of a practically useful time standard, such as [International Atomic Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time), the relativistic corrections are necessary.

For the paper I'm writing at the moment it will be uploaded somewhere, because one of the funding agencies for the project state in their terms that the data should be made public.

You could even model part of a track as a straight line, or other simple curve and do a very simple calculation.  Does the mass of the car matter for the velocity, or is it like simple falling object that depends only on the gravitational constant?  If you find a video of a coaster, make some measurements, like velocity at the top and bottom -- that should get you kinetic energy (after an estimate of the mass).

0x952;"""Why"" is kind of a trap when talking about evolutionary biology. Things gain and lose not just based on what sees them through to reproduce, but also for no reason at all. Why did humans develop different colored irises? There's an argument to be made for sexual preference of mates, but it doesn't offer any direct benefit for survival necessarily besides absorbing different amounts of light. I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.  ""How"" did soybeans start making more amino acids and how did that not impact their survival (i.e., how did their proteins not all clump up and kill them) is biochemistry stuff.\n\nFor the philosophers, I'll leave the wise words of my friend Joe Dirt: ""[""Why's a tree good?

However, the pigment Prussian blue, iron(II/III) hexacyanidoferrate(II/III) is easily accessible. The cyanide ions are very stably bound as ligands to a central iron ion. It's not practical to liberate them using acids.

0x248c;"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence."

In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others.

0x3b7;Observing IS interacting! There is no way to measure the result of the experiment without interacting with the wave. I believe the use of the word â€œobservingâ€ with quantum experiments is really misleading. There is nothing special about us that changes quantum behavior by consciously observing the experiment - ANY interaction between waves will cause it to collapse, regardless of whether we see it happen or not. If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and donâ€™t look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector. Observer or no observer, the electrons still collapse onto the detector in the same way. \n\nObserving is simply the conscious recording of an interaction - it is the interaction that causes the wave to collapse, not the observation.

0xed9;Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor or researcher, and I haven't read anything about ibuprofen vs. COVID vaccines, but I'll take a stab at it:\n\nInflammation (aches, soreness) is part of the human body's immune response to infection or vaccines. Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory, and thus might work to lessen the inflammation triggered by the vaccine (maybe, I dunno for sure).\n\nIbuprofen wears off fairly quick, so any anti-inflammatory action should be short-lived. Ideally. But taking more ibuprofen is something to be wary of. \n\nDid you completely negate the vaccine with one dose of ibuprofen? Unlikely (but I don't know for sure). The immune response consists of more than just inflammation (white blood cell recruitment, memory-cell generation) that takes a while to generate maximum protection (two weeks for full effect). My **guess** is taking ibuprofen for one out of fourteen days wouldn't make much difference. \n\nIf someone wants to correct me, and/or link to studies of vaccines and ibuprofen, please feel free.

0x2808;">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent â€” after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)"

0xc35;I think part 3 is actually the problem with that idea!\n\nThere are two parts to your adaptive immune system: The first is humoral immunity, which refers to antibody production and what we often talk about.\n\nBut the second is cellular immunity - thatâ€™s your T cells, and what they do is look for cells that are internally producing foreign proteins and literally kill them off, on the theory that producing a foreign protein is a sign of being infected.\n\nSo if we integrated spike protein DNA into our cells, the cells would then be detected up by T cells trained against the spike protein as â€œcells producing foreign proteinsâ€ and killed off.  Itâ€™s a good system for protecting us, but probably makes this idea not the most viable!

0xb9d;"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate."

That will be the Limit of Detection (LOD) which is the smallest amount of acetic acid you can detect.\n\nSecond is repeatability.  Take a big bottle of any type of acorbic acid at any concentration (but relevant to your experiment is best).  Homogenize it.  Split it into 10 equal or at least known masses.  Do the titration on those 10 samples and make a results table (include all results, even outliers).  Determine the standard deviation.  That's your experimental error.\n\nPotential error in your experiment is cleanliness.  Have you calibrated the DCPIP concentration with another known standard?  Are you maybe washing the DCPIP burette with water and subtly changing the concentration each time?  Ascorbic acid can oxidize in the air so you need to keep solutions stoppered and don't take hours to do the test.\n\nThe titration end point is very sharp, it's easy to overshoot.  You should ideally be using about 10-15 mL of DCPIP solution in a pH 3 buffer.

At every individual point, the intensity is indeed lower due to 1/rÂ² laws, and your eyes arenâ€™t big enough to catch all that light, but in the entire steradian, the amount of light remains constant, hence the intensity per steradian, is constant.

0x1535;"I highly recommand Dehaene's work on the neural correlates of consciousness, because, as it turns out, we do know a great deal about the ""sit"" of consciousness and what it's made of.\n\n>After discussing the empirical tests able to identify what kinds of stimulus lead to conscious perception, as opposed to unconscious ones, he identifies four signatures of conscious access:\n\n> - The amplification of an early sensory signal leading it to an â€œignitionâ€ of circuits in the parietal and prefrontal circuits\n> - The appearance of a slow P3 wave in an electroencephalogram, a slow massive wave throughout the parietal and prefrontal regions about 300 milliseconds after the stimulus\n> - A late and sudden burst of high frequency oscillations, gamma band power\n> - A synchronization of information exchanges across distant brain regions with oscillations in sync\n\n> All of this is referred to as â€œthe conscious avalancheâ€, the widespread activation of neural activity in a network including the prefrontal and parietal regions whenever a perception makes it into consciousness.\n\n> Which leads to Dehaeneâ€™s theory of consciousness, the global neuronal workspace, a variation of Barnard Baarsâ€™ global workspace theory.  The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> â€¦According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. Thatâ€™s because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it."

0x19be;That's likely but the other explanation is access to sequencing. At least in the US, the Covid relief bill included funding for sequencing Covid across many patients.

Considering the seriousness of Covid, there are ongoing sequencing efforts in many countries across the globe so just having more eyes on mutations will reveal mutations. I think it's hard to make a comparison simply because we are dedicating so much effort to just sequencing compared to previous viruses.

Now, yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea, but that's what research is for, right? Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen.

0x99f;Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so whatâ€™s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because itâ€™s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind weâ€™re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocketâ€™s increasing power given by F x V.

0x24ff;"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes. A chemist cares a lot more about ""what can I do with it"", and for heavy metals, the answer is, not a lot."

0xe9;"Airplanes are exactly what I am talking about. Instead of accepting flying less often, we are willing to spend twice as much ready-to-use electricity as is equivalent to the energy used in a flight to ""store energy"" as a CO2 deficit to fill later. But ok: if flights start to be priced including the cost of energy for CO2 recovery from high altitudes, maybe prices will become realistic and people will fly less anyway.\n\nBut for airplanes it is not just that: they deposit the CO2 at high altitudes, where it remains for a longer time with a multiplied warming effect of a ton at ground level [by a factor of 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305689?via%3Dihub \n). This also artificially decreases the gradient of the CO2 density with altitude, so you have a constant increased radiative forcing effect and it takes longer for the CO2 to diffuse to meet the deficit produced on the ground."

I'm also interested in what other particles you expect to come out if the Majorana thing turns out to be true?\n\nAnd I guess the initial question stands: do you really think that evidence of oscillation means ""there are almost certainly sterile neutrinos""? As I said, I've never heard anyone seriously make this argument before. This could likely cause a yelling match in any relevant conference room in the world."
0xd20;Grignard reactions are next to impossible to run in flow reactors, but I see what you mean.
0x20a2;This isn't the right narrative. The correct story is that there are at least two contributions to DE which sum up to the observed value. One of them comes from a generic prediction of QFTs. This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related. Of course people have developed various solutions to this, so it is possible to relate them, but they aren't really testable at the moment.

In a couple of countries (the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech republic, Switzerland) is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use, regardless on the reason why you are using it. But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal, possession and sale surely are. There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals; e.g. levo-methamphetamine and d-pseudoephedrine, but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them. And returning to your ""science project"", as others have said, only participants can take the drug, not the ones testing its effects. If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if you're lucky you are gonna get to use the drug, but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride, as other routes of administration are far more likely (for example orally or intravenously). In every case, whatever you do, just be responsible and apply every harm reduction strategy you can. Methamphetamine, just like any other pharmaceutical, is not a joke and you should be extremely careful while handling it if you don't desire to seriously harm yourself."

0x37e;When the ball rebounds away from you the magnitude of the impulse (change in momentum) is the same for you and the ball but in opposite directions.\nImpulse is proportional to the mass and the change in velocity, which means the change in velocity is inversely proportional to the mass.\nYou have more mass than the ball (no offence), so your change in velocity is smaller than the ball's.\nNow the rebound happens over the same timeframe for both you and the ball, it is the duration of time where the ball is in contact with you during the rebound.\nAcceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it took to change.\nTherefore the acceleration is higher for the ball than it is for you, because the change in velocity is higher and it happens across the same timeframe.\n\nI hope that helps.

0x24d9;For comparison, we could look to beta plus decay. A free proton will never decay because such a process is energetically banned, but bound inside a nucleus, this becomes possible because the energy situation has changed (the mass of the daughter nucleus is less than that of the mother, since nuclear mass is a complex function of number of protons and neutrons). So, similar idea here. The energy conditions strongly suppress or outright ban neutron decay in the star, which can also happen for various nuclei. I don't know my neutron star physics, so I can't comment on how exactly the process is suppressed--your explanation intuitively makes sense though.

0xe24;You make some good points, but I think itâ€™s important to recognize that carbon capture companies that sequester their carbon rather than using it for energy would be making money primarily via government funding. \n\nYes, they could in principle come to rely on there being more CO2 emitted so that it was worth it for the plant to be functioning, but this would only be an issue if the government was unable to pass laws that required a switch to clean energy. You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldnâ€™t pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that itâ€™s important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I donâ€™t think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.

But for any competent physicist, they will not make the mistake of ignoring the fact that the starting time of your bullet has a built-in +10s error due to the light signal you use has non-infinite speed. \n\nJust think about this experiment: if you have an old style cannon firing over a hill toward you, will you calculate the speed of the cannon ball as the distance divided by the time between when you hear the cannon shot and when the ball hits? No, the cannon's correct travel time must count in the travel time for the sound of the cannon.

0x18c1;"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies."

0x155d;Look at their Lewis structure. They only have three valence electrons. To form covalent bonds, they can only give those three electrons, each into one bond. By doing that they form three covalent bonds and get six electrons in the outer shell. They have no 'capacity' to form more, so they're the exception to the octet rule.\n\nOf course the real story gets more complicated and there's more to bonding than the octet rule. Aluminium doesn't form covalent compounds only either, but let's say even in ionic compounds it is trivalent. \n\nLike Sea\_Wind\_2705 said, it's just a simplified rule according to one theory. More accurate theories are more complicated and are not taught at high school level (only rarely for those that compete).

Especially try to read about Carnot's original understanding of the problem. Here's a hint that will no doubt get me in trouble with some people: anytime someone uses the word 'entropy' in thermodynamics you can just substitute the word 'heat'.

My friend in soft matter spends all day in the lab fabricating micro-robots and basically lives in the engineering department.

Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good."

0x1682;"Yup, I think this might be the best observation. There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA, and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids. So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\n\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

0x1a7e;Social Empathy: The Art of Understanding Others\n-by Elizabeth Segal \n\nI read this one for an English class of all things.

The only one that showed up in any significant way was cognitive because empathy is a cognitive process. But thereâ€™s nothing specifically related to intelligence. I would say that self-awareness is itâ€™s own type of intelligence but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s what youâ€™re asking. So based on this researcherâ€™s findings, I think the answer to your question is no. There is not a correlation between intelligence and empathy.

0x149d;"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate."

0x10fa;"Agreed on false equivalence; I am not advocating MOND, or suggesting that it's a superior alternative to fit observational evidence -  we indeed have sufficient models for this. What I am suggesting however is that the largest technical breakthroughs in a theory tend to be ""hacks"" in the sense that, without a broader framework, they stitch together potentially disparate mathematical techniques in order to parsimoniously explain observations. This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it. Instead I am suggesting that these models hint at a deeper narrative we haven't grasped and that is reflected in their simplicity and disjointedness."

0x651;My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to. I still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity.

I think that itâ€™s still worthwhile to research and develop carbon capture though because should we manage to switch away from fossil fuels, thereâ€™s still a lot of CO2 currently in the atmosphere that we could remove to reverse warming. \n\nOne other thing to mention is related to my other comment in this thread: small molecule adsorbing materials (CO2 adsorbing materials being one of them) have a lot of potential for filtering pollutants out of gas and water, and itâ€™s probably a good thing for carbon capture to get attention and likely in the process help more research and funding go to understanding and developing such materials.

Is general intelligence simply the average of one's different types of intelligence?

For example, Nickola Tesla was an ""intelligent"" individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence. Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence, even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science.

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

And would that imply that  the cosmic redshift is not a result of expanding space, but the opposite?\n\nBut my most important question is, at what point did I start to merely speculate and let the bs flow?"
0x1dfb;As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.

0x160f;Technically gophers have fur-lined cheek pouches, and most of the critters that people call gophers are not actually gophers, but ground squirrels.\n\nGroundhogs, prairie dogs and marmots are all different species of ground squirrels.  In fact, there are several different species of each of those types.\n\nGophers are relatively small rodents in the Family Geomyidae, live almost entirely underground, and do not live in colonies.  They feed on plant roots, not seeds, and are rarely seen by people, coming to the surface only at night to push dirt out of their burrows.  They are often mistaken for moles, but those are something else entirely, in a different Order, and eat mostly bugs and worms.\n\nThe various ground squirrels are rodents in the Family Sciuridae.  They live in communal burrows, with some species having hundreds or even thousands of individuals in the colony.  They mostly eat seeds and some leaves and flowers, plus bugs, eggs, nuts or discarded French fries.  They gather food on the surface during the day, retreating to their burrows at night, as protection from predators, and to hibernate through the winter.

0x8ae;Ok, so Ek=1/2 m v ^2. If the mass of the second cart increases that would obviously increase m. \nHowever, we know m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2. If we change the mass of m2 but don't change the mass or velocity of cart 1, then m1u1 would be the same. m2u2 and m1v1 would be 0 as the carts are expected to be stationary (or is it I'm unsure about this). This would lead to a decrease in v2 to satisfy conservation of momentum if I'm correct.\n\nHowever when I do Ek = 1/2 m v^2 using  the mass and velocities of cart 2, it does not equal the initial kinetic energy of using Ek = 1/2 m v^2 when I use the mass and velocities of cart 1.

0x134e;"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end."

Most of the stuff that you can imagine is already well-understood unless youâ€™re a research chemist.\n\nBroadly speaking, you identify characteristics of compounds and use that to predict how it will behave. Is it an acid/base? Is it a reducing/oxidizing agent? Is it radioactive?\n\nOnce you know enough chemistry, you can have a vague idea of how to answer those questions and what those answers will mean in the context of a particular system.

Itâ€™s especially pronounced in gasses and fluids since their molecules arenâ€™t stuck together like solids.\n\nWe can express this as the ideal gas law\n\n(Pressure) x (Volume of container) = (amount of gas) x (Conversion ratio) x (Temperature). \n\nSince the amount of air isnâ€™t changing, and the volume of container isnâ€™t either, change to temperature has a directly proportional effect on the pressure of the bottle.\n\nEventually the pressure overcomes the weight of the lid, and latch.\n\nIt then equalizes pressure, gas leaves the system, and the lid falls, closing.\n\nActually similar to how the coolant in your car engine gets distributed. There is a flow regulator they call a thermostat that as it gets warmer it expands and lets through more coolant starting at some designated temp. If it gets cool it provides less coolant. Itâ€™s a self regulating system, and how your car engine always stays at the same temp once itâ€™s heated up.

His mind is completely made up no matter what any data says and so he will look for any way to misinterpret data to fit his narrative.\n\nPeople don't want to engage him in this kind of back and fourth as he has a history of not acting in good faith.

In paramecium two (iirc) haploid micro-nuclei get exchanged and then the paramecium detach from one another, then the nuclei fuse. In that instance the fusion of the paramecium would be Plasmogamy, then, later, when they detach and the nuclei fuse that would be Karyogamy.\n\nUsually Karyogamy follows after the plasmogamy. In some instances though, like some Basidiomycota Plasmogamy and Karyogamy happen at vastly different times. First the Hypha of two individuals fuse when they meet, and then, when the conditions are right the nuclei fuse and the mushrooms form their fruiting bodies to expel their spores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I'm not very knowledgable about Myxomycota however (or slime molds) and would recommend checking out the subreddit for that, as it does exist and the people there are very much willing to answer those questions.

0xa06;The force holding the cars up is friction. Any object traveling in a circle is accelerating towards the center of the circle, so the car is pressed into the wall (it would fly off in a straight line if the wall disappeared, and each point on the wall ahead of the car is slightly closer to the center of the circle relative to the trajectory of the car at any point, so the car is constantly pushed towards the center as it moves forward). The pressure into the wall creates static friction with the wheels (point of contact of a moving tire is stationary) which provides an upwards force against gravity. The wall is also slanted, so the wall itself provides some force upward on the car due to gravity, adding even more to the friction force.  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/inclined-planes-friction/v/static-and-kinetic-friction-example  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-forces/a/what-is-centripetal-force

This lead trapped inside the SiO2 or B if you have borosilicate doesn't come out of the lattice as easily, because to the best of my knowledge it replaces a Si atom. Although, depending on the pH of what you consume you might leach some Pb into your meal, so I would say it all depends. If you leach some of the Pb on the surface of the material, then you know that in the future uses the Pb that is deeper in the material won't come out as easily, hence the recommendation of washing these types of crystals before using."

0x1c88;The velocity at the outlet is derived [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli%27s_law#Derivation). In the last line of the derivation, they assume the pressures outside the tank and at the top of the fluid column are both atmospheric, but that's not the case here. So what you want is the second-to-last equation, which contains both the contributions from the height of the tank, and from the pressure difference.\n\nAnd you can see how that varies as you change the position of the hole in the tank. If the pressure difference between inside and outside is dominant, then moving the hole up or down will have little effect on the flow velocity, and the velocity will be proportional to the square root of the pressure difference.

0x2477;There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.

0xd42;"> currently Iâ€™m doing maths chem and physics but do you think thatâ€™s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar"

0x1f57;It depends on the depth to which you want to dive. \n\nTo give the basic gestalt: \n\nLight enters through the air into your cornea, through the pupil and onto the retina surface of the eye. \n\nTwo types of receptors in retinal tissue, called rods and cones, sense the light and convert them into physiological electricity in the form of an action potential. \n\nThese action potentials travel through fibers that travel back to the brain via the optic nerve. \n\nDepending on the location within the eye orbit, the fibers have a different pathway to the brain. \n\nThe fibers located in the retina on the side of your nose cross over just after entering the skull, at the optic chiasm. \n\nThis allows the left side of your vision to be stored on the right side of your brain, and your right side vision to be on the left side of the brain.  (the brain has a thing for crossing over like this).\n\nFrom here, the fibers travel to the thalamus, which further divides them by where they originated in the retina. \n\nFrom the thalamus, the fibers travel to specific parts of the occipital cortex, depending on whether they originated in the superior part of retina, or the inferior part of the retina. \n\nThese fibers travel to distinct locations in the occipital cortex. \n\nThe brain processes these impulses and produces your perception of your surroundings. \n\nObviously, great amounts of time can be explaining the nuances of vision.

Once the string breaks the tension force is gone and you have only the force of gravity, with the ball initially continuing to move on the same speed and direction it had the instant the string broke. The ball will then take a ballistic trajectory.

Do populations with high IQs have stronger empathy as a learned and adhered to cultures standards?

0x5b4;Itâ€™s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didnâ€™t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earthâ€™s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. Iâ€™m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely werenâ€™t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldnâ€™t have replaced oil. It also wasnâ€™t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you donâ€™t make a compelling case for why we shouldnâ€™t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesnâ€™t mean we shouldnâ€™t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.

0x1a71;Good Morning, \n\nGiven that you are vaccinated I am sure that you know logically that you are unlikely to contract COVID. Also, you have indicated that you are aware that if you DO happen to contract COVID it is unlikely to cause serious GI upset. Multiplying those two probabilities based on 90% vaccine effectiveness and 25% of people having GI upset (that is your estimation I don't know the real number) would be 0.1 x 0.25 = .025 x 100 % = 2.5 % chance of you developing this dreaded symptom and 97.5 % chance of NOT doing so. However, you know this intuitively meaning that the real source of your anxiety is just anxiety itself. It is your feelings surrounding this issue, not your logical thoughts. I would recommend approaching this the way people normally approach anxiety. Things like mindfulness, breathing techniques, therapy if that is an option. \n\nRegarding the constipation: Fiber is probably a good idea to address that as suggested by others. Chronic constipation is not healthy.

0x2335;Iâ€˜m sure that there are other good approaches to this, but this is what I would recommend.\n\nIf by â€žpretty much nothingâ€œ you really mean nothing I would say start what at an atom is and how it is built. Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you donâ€˜t understand these things you wonâ€˜t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once youâ€˜ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what youâ€˜re interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if thatâ€˜s something you like.

0xb49;A valuable lesson to learn if you're interested in chemistry is that 'rules' like 'always wanting to match the nearest noble gas' are almost always simplifications that don't always apply and reality is often a lot more complicated. \n\n In this case, there are a lot of factors that go into what oxidation states an element can be found in (which is essentially what you're asking here) such as having a filled (or half filled) electron shell (or subshell), which orbitals you're adding/removing electrons to/from, how much shielding from inner electrons there is and even relativity comes into it. For thallium specifically, from what I can tell it seems like it most commonly either loses 1 or 3 electrons, but other oxidation states are also possible.

0x26a9;"60 applications with 2 interviews is a very low success rate. There may be something systematic on your end that you're doing/not doing over your qualifications. A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria.

So it's better to at least use the right words so people can connect what they're reading here with what they've read and heard elsewhere.

Below is the data I think is relevant:  \nDiameter: 3 feet  \nHeight: 20 feet  \nAverage Minnesota January temperature: 22Â° / 6Â° (in F)  \nDoes anyone have an idea how long it will take to freeze? Will it be better if I fill the tube with a foot of water every day instead of to the top in the first day?

0x14d2;Iâ€™m in the UK, so things are a little different, but the same principles apply (and Iâ€™ve met students from a range of countries). In my professional life, I spent a lot of my time supporting students who were in the same place as you are now, so I can appreciate your concerns.\n\nStudying at University is a big change from school, so you may well find University challenging initially. Thatâ€™s completely normal. You say you study hard, and Iâ€™m sure you do, but perhaps you need to rethink <how> you study. Do you just read through stuff repeatedly? Do you work through practice examples? If you have to do tests, do you work through practice tests? If you have to do essays, do you do practice essays? If you read through stuff, donâ€™t just read it. Itâ€™s better to make lists of the main points that the book / website / resource is making, for example. That will help fix it in your memory and identify areas youâ€™re not sure of - you can return to those later.\n\nIâ€™d expect performance to improve as students progress from year to year, because they become more experienced in studying - in other words, their â€˜study skillsâ€™ improve. In the UK, most universities would run study skills sessions for students, particularly in their first year: I donâ€™t know if sessions like that are available in your institution. If there are, it might be helpful if you took part. How approachable are your tutors? It might also be worth speaking with them and asking their advice.\n\nA very big change to your programme of study needs careful consideration. I suggest you donâ€™t make a switch unless you are VERY sure you want to do it, and can make a list - you might want to type it out - of reasons why itâ€™s a good idea, and why you will â€˜copeâ€™ better in that new area.

0x1896;"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation."
0x110d;"Try ether with acetonitrile! Pentane and acetonitrile arenâ€™t miscible. Generally, when choosing a solvent system, ensure they are miscible; there are plenty of miscibility charts available online. \nAlso itâ€™s easier imo if you add the anti solvent to the scintillation vial before you add the dram (smaller) vial to it. And a final tip for this technique would be to avoid disturbing the vial while waiting for it to crystallize. \nThere are other techniques one can try too. You can cool a saturated solution or, as someone mentioned, carefully layer a solvent and anti-solvent (and, if you wish, cool it as well). And in case nobody has explicitly defined it, an antisolvent is a solvent that your compound isnâ€™t soluble in. \nFinally make sure to give your crystals lots of encouragement; they need it to grow! :)"

This would allow the light from our torch to under go destructive interfernces. And make the specific point dark. But this is a very difficult and highly improbable scenerio considering phase of light can change with path difference and even the air inside the room can contribute to a difference which would mean we won't get a 100 percent result.

0x3c6;Plants use only about 1% of absorbed water for photosynthesis. According to Law of Limiting Factors, the rate of the reaction is determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. Now, when water is so scarce, water stress causes the stomata to close and hence reduces CO2 availability, water stress also causes the leaves to wilt and reduces their metabolic activity. So, the effect of water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant rather than directly on photosynthesis.

0x2533;The answer to that is kind of complicated, Iâ€™m no expert but Iâ€™ll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.

0x6c3;I am not a 100% sure if I am right, but from what I know, conjugation is the exchange of genetic material between two organisms through fusion or by making a connection in simplified terms, therefore it is a type of sexual reproduction, you don't call the fusion of spores or gametes as conjugation.\nSyngamy is the fusion of two gametes, it includes the two processes of \nplasmogamy, followed by karyogamy.\n\nPlasmogamy  is the fusion of the cytoplasm of two spores or gametes. It occurs after conjugation in some organisms, but conjugation is not necessary for plasmogamy, most organisms release spores or gametes into the environment therefore conjugation is mostly not required.\nKaryogamy is the fusion of the nucleus. In some organism karyogamy is quite delayed after plasmogamy such as in certain kinds of fungi.\nI hope this helps, you will get a much clearer idea of these if you choose to take biology in higher classes. Also it's quite tricky because protista has one of the most complex life cycles in all organisms on earth.

0x1ae0;Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares. At least you'd imagine they'd teach you how that cycle is logically discovered, but fuck no.\n\nAlso be warned a typical Chem or bio graduate has nothing to do with healthcare. The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do. Buy them a lunch and they will tell you their childhood secrets along with it, it works just that wonderfully.

0x199c;Gravitational potential energy is approximated for short falls, such as a flight of deck stairs, as mgh, or mass times the acceleration of gravity times the height. In this case, 77.1 \* 9.8 \* the height of 5 stairs. This quantity is equal to the kinetic energy Johnny has gained by the time he reaches the bottom, which is equal to 1/2\*m\*v\^2. Since you know his mass, 77.1 kilograms, you can solve for his final velocity to determine his momentum upon hitting the ground - which is found by multiplying his mass by his final velocity. The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop. That's because Johnny's change in momentum, which again is mass times velocity, is equal to the impulse he receives from the ground, which is force times time. Therefore, a more drawn out or cushioned impact results in a smaller force.

But the same is true if you picked a basis where spin out is (1,0) and spin in is (0,1), and then wrote spin up/down in this basis.

0x1add;There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.

If you're more interested in Chemistry and that's what you want to pursue, I think a pure Chemistry major would be better for you.\n\nKeep in mind, you will probably have difficulty with finding a chemistry-related job right out of your undergrad with either of these majors, as both of these fields are quite popular and  professional work usually requires a masters education or higher.\n\nDon't let that discourage you though! Usually, the only people who get high-paying jobs right out of their undergrad are Engineers and CompSci/Tech students. If Chemistry is your passion, ride the wave. There aren't as many people these days going into just pure chemistry as there are in chem engineering, biochem, or other applications.\n\nIt's a difficult major, but if you stick it out and commit to learning instead of faking your way through school, you will definitely be able to get a good job.

There can't be any inertia (other than in the forward direction), that permanently angles the bike to one side or the other. In your example, once the bike has rotated, the inertia to the right will either mean you tilt to the right and ultimately fall over to the right, or it will be slowed by a force coming from the contact between your bike and the road. As soon as you go forward, there isn't any total net inertia in another direction per definition (or you would move that way).\n\nAssuming the bike doesn't slip, it will rotate around the point where it touches the ground. A force on the right means a net torque to the right\n\n    _____\n      |  |\n      |  \/\n      |\n      |\n\nmeans the bike will tilt left (or turn, or fall).\n\n    _____\n      \  |\n       \ \/\n        \\n         \

0x276e;PhD in Physics is always a great option. My colleague physicist worked in all-physicists team (8 of them) during his time in quantitative finance on Wall Street. \n\nDuring interviews they asked new candidates (physicists) Schrodingerâ€™s equation (from quantum physics) and questions from physics to save time on interviews.\n\nSome other quant investment fonds also explicitly ask for PhDs (eg. RenTech).\n\nEdit: If you want to switch to finance later, as a physicist you would just take some books in quant finance, or just 1 book (John Hull is the most popular), because you would already know mathematical modeling and calculus, so it wouldnâ€™t be a problem to learn financial terms from there (eg. derivatives, futures etc.) The mathematical background is completely necessary on the other hand.

0x2258;Keep in mind there are thousands of identified serotypes of Salmonella enterica and relatively few cause disease in humans.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Salmonella is not randomly distributed, but patchy by location and variable over time. So even if you knew the worlwide average risk of getting Salmonellosis by eating a cooked chicken, it would not be very useful. It's like asking the likelihood of picking a US citizen at random from the world population. That average likelihood won't protect you if you drop a pin in Kansas but will make you cautious without need if the pin lands in North Korea.\n\nA quick literature search indicates most chickens (one source estimated conservatively 92% of sampled chickens) have *some* form of Salmonella in their gut, so I can't recommend eating raw chicken intestines. It is virtually all gone before the chicken slips into the plastic attire you see it in.\n\nIf it's your day to worry, though, one Salmonella serotype us the cause of typhoid fever, which is more serious than salmonellosis.

0x1667;"I found this on the World Wide Web:\n\nNo shape can â€œamplifyâ€ sound.\n\nSound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source.\n\nIf you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a â€œbeamâ€ of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if itâ€™s coupled poorly to the air, it wonâ€™t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not â€œamplifyâ€, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)"

0x88f;I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to check some of the formal definitions on a book such as Quantum Chemistry by Levine, they come mostly from working the Hydrogen Atom but there's plenty of nuances on its treatment and **i would not recommend taking my analogy on word alone**.
0x853;"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesnâ€™t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. Iâ€™m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someoneâ€™s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. â€œEconomic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient airâ€ (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what Iâ€™ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. Thereâ€™s nothing saying the second law efficiency canâ€™t be better than 5%, and also it doesnâ€™t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency wonâ€™t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation â€œLackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.â€ In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology wonâ€™t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I donâ€™t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldnâ€™t be feasible no matter how efficient it got."

0x7b8;Honestly there are a few other factors.  Most heat will be transferred through actual diffusion of air, not just conduction through window pane glass.  So if you have a lot of airflow, that will increase the rate of stabilizing the temperature (outside and inside being the same temperature). The only way that curtains will help is by blocking airflow to the window where conduction or diffusion (air escaping through tiny gaps) will happen.  But you could achieve a similar effect with something transparent (shower curtains honestly would be more than enough and prevent a decent amount of conduction).\n\nThe sun's radiated heat can be a huge factor in warming an area.  I would try to make sure you allow in as much of that heat as you can.

0x271b;Not my expertise but no one's answered yet. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, please.\n\nAnyways, to answer, I'm seeing 2 alternatives to the cubic unit cell. The tetrahedron and a hexagonal thing. The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.

0x2411;"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory."

0xc6e;"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all. But again, I digress.\n\nI hope this answered your question somewhat."

0x9fe;Thereâ€™s an interesting neutron lifetime â€œpuzzleâ€, where different types of experiments measure different values for the lifetime. Bottle experiments (like this one, which measure neutrons that **do not** decay) measure a lifetime about 10 s less than beam experiments (which measure neutrons that **do** decay). This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesnâ€™t help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity. Also, the neutron lifetime is an important parameter in Big Bang nucleosynthesis because it determines the ratio of protons to neutrons prior to the beginning of formation of heavier nuclei.\n\nThe neutron source is rad hot. We use a 800 MeV proton beam to produce spallation neutrons, and then cool them to UCN energy levels. Solid D2 is used in the final step to downscatter cold neutrons to ultracold neutrons.

Be very careful, this is dangerous. If you want to start simple and safe(ish), get 3 things, copper wire, steel wool and magnesium ribbon. Heat the copper to red hot with a lighter, blowtorch etc. It might melt a bit and once you take it off heat, it will go black. This is copper oxide forming. Next, burn the steel wool, this will self sustain the reaction, but nothing extremely violent. Finally, light the magnesium ribbon and see how violent the reaction is in comparison to the others.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is the best place to start because it can be demonstrated with ease and it explains why reactions happen, like iron rusting in the presence of water.\n\nIâ€™d recommend watching YouTube videos that interest you, especially those from periodic videos, Nile red, Nurd rage, Grant thompson(the king of random 4 years ago) and Codyâ€™s lab

0x1b97;Hi everyone! I'm not a STEM student but I've spent a great deal of time reading physics textbooks and watching Walter Lewin's lectures. I went over a great deal of concepts (classical mechanics and most of electromagnetism that you would find in a college textbook).  \nNow that I'm working full-time, I need to find a time-efficient resource to focus on understanding how things work on a fundamental level. The problem with college textbooks and videos is that they are quite time intensive, I would like something that just explains concepts and formula, making it simple and intuitive through the use of analogy. This way I can just spend not so long on absorbing new contents and spend more time about thinking how to use these formula to solve real life problem. I'm not trying to take exams, just trying to understand how The Universe works to help me think through things and learn circuit and electronics (don't want to learn only that though, I want to learn everything that undergraduate are learning). Do you have know any resource that could help me? Thank you all very much!

Feynmanâ€™s basic idea was that a quantum mechanical system, with several subsystems, for each qubit, provides as many traditional bits as would be needed on a traditional computer to express that state of a quantum mechanical system. For example, **2 qubits are equivalent to 512 bits, 10 qubits are equivalent to 16 kB** and so on with exponential growth. Also understood at the time was how difficult it was to build large computers that could handle qubit demands.\n\nWhere are these numbers coming from? As I understand it, 2 qubits should representable by 2\^2 =4 bits.

However, the other part of the story is metabolism. Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \n\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body.

0x22d;A plant uses water for turgidity, it occupies the interstitial cell space and creates rigidity with the increase in pressure. Water is also used as a reactant in photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle for ATP & sugar for organelle function, reproduction, structure, etc. The plant takes the stores of water from the vacuoles (along w sugar stores) when it isnâ€™t available (drought, â€œforgot I owned a plantâ€, etc.). \nA great deal of a plantâ€™s mass is water and cellulose, using it for an endothermic reaction like photosynthesis requires it for interaction, but the cost is shared with solar energy. Water is abundant in the plantâ€™s structure. Itâ€™s almost akin to your hair and skin getting dry because youâ€™re dehydrated because your organs need that water more, the wilting, dry skin. There are also all kinds of adaptations for water regulation in plants in different climates. Evergreen plants are particularly interesting for this.

0x5d0;">To address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. \n\nA slight correction to this -- the CO2 doesn't really *re-emit* the photon.  Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.  This difference in the process is crucial for understanding the fine details of the greenhouse effect; however, it is almost trivial at the same time, given that the black-body radiation (mostly IR for something at \~300K) of a substance is temperature-dependent."

0x143e;Iâ€™m familiar with Hoppes from a past life - back then I stored the bottles in a hermetically sealed metal container (actually an old ammunition box). I wouldnâ€™t keep bottles of it in the house, mainly because of the risk of dropping the bottle and breaking it. Iâ€™m also familiar with safety data sheets and (in the UK the â€˜Control of Substances Hazardous to Healthâ€™) from my time in labs. Solvents such as amyl acetate (one of the components) can attack some plastics, so probably that component leached through the plastic zip bag. The smell is quite penetrating, so thatâ€™s probably what you can smell. I doubt if you will have any adverse effects, as the double bagging would have reduced the amount of solvent escaping considerably. Some people can smell it at lower concentrations than others, but judging from your description it seems unlikely that you had a significant exposure. Faintly smelling it doesnâ€™t sound to me to be a lot if exposure. You can google exposure limits of the different components youâ€™ll see in the safety data sheet for further information.\nKeep your closet door open, and open the window in that room for a while. The smell should slowly dissipate. If I were you, I would store solvents like that in your garage if you have one. Metal NATO ammo boxes are great for storage as they have rubber seals and are very robust - Iâ€™ve used them for years.

0xa21;"I don't know that we have an *urgent* need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\nIf, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life)."

0xdb5;Why not a baby crocodile?\n\nEdit: The find is clearly a very worn, central-only portion of the top of a skull. Note that the eye sockets are less than half present and the nostrils barely show at the edges (the six distinct, round holes are vascular/neural foramen). \n\nThe full skull was obviously considerably larger, speculatively 9 to 15 inches long. It is totally unlike any fish skull (for one example, the bone is porous like warm-blooded animals'). No bird skull is near that size or that heavily built. The full skull would have been too large to be any reptile except a crocodilian. No large mammal has an upper skull shape remotely like that. It was found on a beach. I think it's from a young American crocodile or American alligator unless clearly shown otherwise.

0x933;1)  Youâ€™d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\n\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\n\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections.

0xa9f;to be honest I dont agree. Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot). A lot of stuff in the lab, especially teaching labs, is not more dangerous than stuff that is commonly used at home, it is important to differentiate. Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good. People should rather learn when to use the respective personal protective equipment.

0x2342;My brother is the nuclear engineer so I know more than the average chemist but I'm no expert. I'm still reasonably certain that this is wrong. You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor. I could 100% be wrong. I think you need to talk to the nuclear engineering reddit to be sure, but that's my understanding.

0x1e7a;We have MeI in one of our boxes and it isn't a problem. Just make sure to turn the blower off and purge thoroughly after using it, obviously.\n\nHave you thoroughly checked for leaks (for example filling the box with He and using a He ion detector)? Maybe check the o-rings on the port doors, since those can sometimes get dirty and lead to leaks.\n\nAnyway, if you're concerned it's the O2 detector acting up, here's something easy you can do: reduce Cp2TiCl2 with excess zinc powder in toluene. The solution should be quite concentrated. You'll get a dark green solution of the Ti(III) complex. Let a few drops of this solution evaporate on a clean surface, while the blower is turned on. If you get a green residue after the toluene evaporates, your atmosphere has only a few ppm of O2 at most and I would point to your O2 detector being the problem here. If it turns yellow you have around ~10 ppm of oxygen in the atmosphere, and if it turns red you have a very big O2 problem.

When we set out with a bias, itâ€™s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along. \nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years. I find it fascinating because everyoneâ€™s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar â€œspiritualâ€ experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether itâ€™s LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imaginedâ€¦the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same â€œentitiesâ€ even if theyâ€™ve never heard reference of them beforehand? Iâ€™m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after â€œmeeting Mother Auyhuascaâ€? How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly?

Itâ€™s precisely why psilocybin, DMT, LSD, and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs. Because it usually changes the way we see the world. It usually causes us to â€œwake upâ€, from this dumb broken system weâ€™ve created. Why does it do that? Well, we donâ€™t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or itâ€™s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. Itâ€™s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool. If science helps discover the truth, and if spirituality is also the truth, then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well.

That's why Australia has one of the highest percentages of skin cancer in the world.

A lighter skin is therefore an adaptation to less sunlight in higher latitudes : with lighter skin, you absorb more sunlight and thus produce more vitamin D. That's why black people often lack vitamin D in North america and northern Europe, and often have to take supplements.

0x9b4;It looks like it is from the family Amaurobiidae. It appears to closely resemble the Callobius bennetti, or the Hacklemesh Spider, however, those are native to North America, and not the UK. I cannot, at this time, narrow it down any further. I have seen a few with this dorsal abdominal pattern, but none so black. It could be Iâ€™m merely finding examples of juveniles, but I think this is a direction you could start looking in. \n\nOne with a close abdominal pattern match:\n\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/49044\n\nOne with similarities in legs and carapace \n\nhttps://arachnoboards.com/gallery/callobius-bennetti.69599/\n\nPatterns and colorings arenâ€™t always the best ways to determine exact species of spiders due to the extreme variations of such during its lifecycle. A spider can change/differ rather drastically from sling to juvenile to adult and from female to male. With each molt brings new changes, new surprises to behold.\nEye arrangements are best to classify family, and typically, leg details such as leg to body proportions, leg shape and placement, and toe count, along with spinneret, pedipalp (of the male), and ventral abdomen (of a female) characteristics help identify the particular species. These last two are usually used by experts, though, and not the general enthusiast, as you have to work fairly hard to get perfectly focused shots of a very minuscule subject at very iffy angles.\nHere is a link to those eye arrangements if youâ€™d like to compare your little fella.\n\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/84423#Amaurobiidae\n\nThis following one matches rather closely, right down to the little white leg accents if you pay attention in photo, the legs on the far side of the body.

0x1aeb;ABS is not UV stable.  Chemical inhibitors are added during manufacture.\n\nWhen the plastic ages, the UV absorbers stop working and an oxygen molecule will snatch a single hydrogen atom from the plastic molecule.  The molecule then slightly re-arranges into a yellow coloured new molecule.  Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.  What you un-intentionally end up doing is scraping off that tiny thin brittle layer to expose fresh plastic underneath.\n\nYou can repeat the process many times so long as you have material remaining.  It's almost exactly like sandpaper over a wooden floor to expose a fresh surface.  And yes, you can do it so many times but not infinite times.  The freshly exposed surface is essentially a new brick with new UV absorbers.\n\nOverall: peroxide + UV bleaching very slightly makes the lego brick a little bit smaller.

Make sure to balance the equations. \n\nBy using the yield of the Ostwald process you can find the ratio of ammonia for the nitric acid to the ammonia used in the final reaction.\n\nThen you should convert the molar ratios into mass ratios (between the ammonia and the ammonium nitrate).\n\nThis should hopefully work. I wasn't quite sure how much you might of forgotten so I just brain dumped my thought process. I might check this calculation on paper to see if I've forgotten any steps  or made a mistake.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter actually checking the molar ratio of the Ostwald process it appears that I overcomplicated it.\n\nAs the Ostwald process is 1:1 (ammonia:nitric acid) the whole process takes 2 ammonia for 1 ammonium nitrate.\n\nSo you can calculate the mass of the product by just getting the moles of ammonia dividing by 2 and then multiplying by the molar mass of ammonium nitrate.

It usually takes weeks/months of concentrated effort to process the data into relevant physics. That's why not even collaborations like LIGO or detectors at CERN make raw data available, and publish only data that has been cooked medium-rare so that it can be further processed into physics that people are looking for (although, in case of those two examples, it's also because the data output depends on input of simulations).

A suspension is rarely the preferred formulation, but if the drug is not freely soluble in the liquid vehicle (preferred), then a suspension is the second choice. Nebulized corticosteroids are formulated like this because of their highly lipophilic nature.\n\nRegarding your second, recent question, I'm specifically avoiding saying yes or no because your question doesn't really describe what's happening in the body. The excipients are needed to create a delivery system for the drug, what happens when these tiny aggregates of drug/excipient/vehicle enter the body can vary according to the agents used, but yes, in most cases, a ""vitamin"" must separate from the excipients to become biologically active. However, an exception might include certain drugs that rely on a carrier molecule to cross a membrane."

0x83c;Thanks!
0x134f;I disagree the fake stats are
0x1731;Many molecules have chains of atoms, including almost all organic compounds like gasoline, sugar, proteins, etc.  \nThe central atom concept applies to each of the atoms in the chain, as a way to explain their geometries. For example, the molecule acetic acid (the sour part of vinegar) is C2H4O2. On one of the C atoms there are three H atoms and then the next C along. The four bonds around that carbon predict a geometry where the angles are roughly 109.5 degrees- the â€œtetrahedralâ€ shape. Then the other C has a three bonds: one from the first C, a (double) bond to one of the oxygen atoms, and a bond to the second oxygen. With three bonds weâ€™ll say the best geometry is planar, with the bonds at 120 degree angles. Finally that second oxygen has the bond to the H atom, plus non-bonding electron pairs.    \nSo even that simple molecule can be thought of as having 3 â€œcentralâ€ atoms.

0xa7c;If you want better answers you need to ask better questions.  Im not trying to be condescending but you would do yourself a huge favor by getting a better grasp on chemistry before trying to grasp molecular biology.  At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.  I'm going to leave this here as if we keep going down this road I won't get any sleep tonight and I'll be explaining how the medium of language & English work and those definitely arent my fortes.

0x1968;Generating energy means that the output of the system is greater than the input. In your case this violates thermodynamics, as there is no energy source other than your hands.

0x9a2;It would be in this case as the Cs is going to react with oxygen and water vapor in the air. If itâ€™s a liquid then when that ampoule shatters droplets of Cs will scatter everywhere, which means the total surface area for reaction will be orders of magnitude higher than it would be if the Cs were still solid. This means the reaction will be faster and more violent with the liquid form, and the result will almost certainly be a genuine explosion due to rapid oxidation of Cs, heat release, generation of H2 gas, and subsequent rapid oxidation of H2 gas.

0x1796;Rule 1 : no homework
0x11fb;We ignore counts in the detector that happen before we lower the detector into the trap, which rejects daughter betas from the periods when we are waiting and allowing UCN to decay.\n\nThe counting process is identical for short and long runs. Any counts for daughter betas would be proportional to the number of UCN in the trap, so it cancels out when we take a ratio between short and long runs.\n\nEDIT: also the cross section for daughter betas to hit the detector is reasonably small and time required to count all UCN in the trap is small relative to the neutron lifetime, so counts from daughter betas are a small fraction of counts.

Normally Iâ€™m the type of person who tries tremendously hard to help an animal where most others would have just shot it or put it down, I leave putting an animal down as the absolute last resort, Iâ€™ve thrown my back out for two weeks literally pushing a horse back up and forcing it to walk because it fell and itâ€™s intestines started to cause it to die, or that it couldnâ€™t get up from an icy surface, literally dragging it over 400 feet until we had it on a hard coarse surface to grab on, and kept a baby deer alive when itâ€™s back legs were broken until I could drive it to someone who could fix it up where it survived and grew up, rather than putting the creature down. Here I would say the creature needed to be put down because it was only getting worse and going to suffer, it already showed signs that it had been in distress for quite a while, at least the creature had someone caring enough to stop and say â€œhey itâ€™s a bug but it needs help.â€ And gave it a safe comfortable place to die.

0x209;Lots of things. \n\nCost effective is always a big cinsideration, but depending on the application you need other considerations.\n\nIf it is for pharmaceuticals or food ingredients and uses a class II metal (Pd, Cd, Ru, etc.)- good turn-over number (TON) is important as this allows lower amounts to be used. Lower loading means you use less and there will be less residual metal.in the final product, reducing the amount of purification, and mitigating risk for contamination. \n\nSlectivity is also important, i.e. - the catalyst doesn't target any other functionalities / components in your reaction system.
0x1d9b;> If I want to spike 5 copies per cell= total lentivirus I would need is 1.25E7\n\nyes\n\n(In your first reply, you showed the wrong number of cells, so the math you wrote there is wrong. But this number is correct, looking at your original post. Check that you agree.)\n\nFor simplicity here, let's say you want an even 1E7 viruses.\n\nThey are at 1E9/uL. (Did you really mean that?) So you would need 0.01 uL. Agree? \n\nNot practical. So let's dilute the viruses.\n\nIf you diluted 1/10, they would be 1E8/uL. You would still need 0.1 uL. \n\nIf you diluted 1/100, they would be 1E7/uL, so you would need 1 uL.\n\n(Note those numbers are for spiking the whole 200 uL of cells at once. If that isn't what you want, you will need to do the numbers for your volumes.)\n\nTo dilute 1/100, you can do  that in one step, or do 1/10 twice. The math is the same. It's just up to you what volumes to handle.\n\nNote that what we are doing here is breaking things down to small steps. One thing at a time. Makes it easier to follow. And round numbers make it easier. Once you think you have a plan, give the actual numbers a final check. (And good to have someone there double-check.)\n\nDo you need to correct for the volume added? Depends how accurate you need to be. If you add 1 uL to 200 uL, probably not. If you added 100 uL, it would be a 1/3 correction. Easy enough in any case.
0x2228;Short answer - it'll be different. \n\nLong answer - let's say, you have 20% (v/v) solution of acetic acid in water. In theory, you have two ingredients in the solution: acetic acid and water. \n\nIn case of this solution containing only pure AcOH and H2O, it's a 20% concentration, and 100% purity.\n\nIf the solution has some salt dissolved in it, it could be 19,95% AcOH, 79,95%H2O, 0,1% NaCl, which is still ~20% AcOH in H2O, but in terms of purity of the solution, it's 99,9% pure.\n\nPurity is calculated in regard of the things you want in your solution - every other thing is a contaminant. Concentration is calculated in regard to how a specific ingredient relates to the rest of the mix, pollutants and contaminations included.

The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers.

0x2292;Disagree. I'm not a knee-jerk anti-nuclear wingnut, but given the dramatic progress in intermittent renewables over the past decade, the use-case for nuclear is substantially smaller than many redditors seem to think it is. There's certainly a good case to be made for nuclear power for clean load-following or baseload electricity generation, but that's about it. My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future. But that's not the world we live in.

0x2594;"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works.

0x1937;"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)"

Your blood cells inherit their DNA from these stem cells.\n\nIf there's something wrong with your marrow (or your blood) and you require a transplant, you've now got someone else's blood stem cells sitting in your bones, making new blood cells. The new blood cells will inherit their DNA from the stem cells that made them, so now you also have blood cells with the donor's DNA in them. This doesn't mean all of the DNA in your body is replaced, it just means your blood in particular is now a genetic mix of cells containing your own DNA (which your own marrow made) and cells containing the donor's DNA (which the donated marrow made).\n\nThis is true for any organ transplant, by the way. If you receive a kidney transplant, the DNA in that kidney doesn't change to match yours.

0x17d7;Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed. It may be possible that stuff like CsTl exists, but I would not bet on it.

0x20c0;"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. Ï† [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of Ï• be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(âˆ’3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their Ï† field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors arenâ€™t trying to do away with dark matter at all â€” their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter."
0x25bc;Eh, it's a bit more complicated than that. There are numerous channels individually at around 3sig (some more). But a reasonable new physics models that explain one of these channels often explain the others. So combining the channels into a single analysis isn't a ridiculous idea. Nonetheless, all of the experts on this I have talked to (on the experimental side, fitting side, or the model building side) are extremely cautious about doing this due to the difficulty in extracting the data from the machines.
0x1d6e;"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions."

0x1f5c;Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.

0x145c;"I highly recommand Dehaene's work on the neural correlates of consciousness, because, as it turns out, we do know a great deal about the ""sit"" of consciousness and what it's made of.\n\n>After discussing the empirical tests able to identify what kinds of stimulus lead to conscious perception, as opposed to unconscious ones, he identifies four signatures of conscious access:\n\n> - The amplification of an early sensory signal leading it to an â€œignitionâ€ of circuits in the parietal and prefrontal circuits\n> - The appearance of a slow P3 wave in an electroencephalogram, a slow massive wave throughout the parietal and prefrontal regions about 300 milliseconds after the stimulus\n> - A late and sudden burst of high frequency oscillations, gamma band power\n> - A synchronization of information exchanges across distant brain regions with oscillations in sync\n\n> All of this is referred to as â€œthe conscious avalancheâ€, the widespread activation of neural activity in a network including the prefrontal and parietal regions whenever a perception makes it into consciousness.\n\n> Which leads to Dehaeneâ€™s theory of consciousness, the global neuronal workspace, a variation of Barnard Baarsâ€™ global workspace theory.  The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> â€¦According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. Thatâ€™s because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it."

So try the hottest water you can getâ€” from the tap or from the stove.  Often when stuff dissolves in water, it stays dissolved for a while even as the water cools down.  Particularly floppy molecules like azelaic acid.  \n\nYou could try dissolving it in isopropyl alcohol or ethanol.

A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience.

0x1ee4;Effector cells are basically the activated cells that carry out a specific function in response to a stimulus. Take B cells - when activated by T cells, they differentiate into effector plasma cells, which are the ones that actively secrete the antibodies. The effector T cells would be the CD4+ Helper T cells and the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Once an infection has been dealt with, sone of the B cells & T cells remain around afterwards, incase the same infection ever occurs again. These are the memory cells and these are not really effector cells.

0x10e2;Basically none unfortunately. If you look at commercial lithium ion batteries they will use some combination of propylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate as a solvent the lithium hexaflurophospate or perchlorate as the salts.\n\nThe reason they need to use these really large counterions is that they are the only salts that are soluble in those solvents. Really highly ionic salts like sulfates are barely soluble in anything but water. They will be slightly soluble in things like ethanol or methanol but the problem with them is they are quite unstable (electrochemically speaking) which means you won't be able to reach high voltages at all.\n\nAlso going to non-aqueous immediately introduces the problem of water sensitivity, your salts will likely be wet and even if you do find a cheap solvent that will dissolve the salts in a desirable concentration then it too will suck up water from the atmosphere over time which can have an effect on performance (again reducing voltage stability)

In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and weâ€™ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I donâ€™t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.

0x5a3;You're just wrong. Yes, the excited vibrational modes can increase the kinetic energy of other molecules in the atmosphere, but CO2 definitely re-emits photons after the initial IR absorption. As with some of your thermodynamics arguments above, it seems like you know enough about some of these things to think that you're right and be able to give a plausible sounding argument, but it seems like you just lack some basic ideas about the specifics. CO2 really does re-emit the photon. Here's a simple link that explains this [fact](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-climate-works/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation#:~:text=Molecules%20of%20carbon%20dioxide%20\(CO,from%20infrared%20\(IR\)%20radiation.&text=The%20energy%20from%20the%20photon,by%20emitting%20another%20infrared%20photon.). Here's another [source](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/02/25/carbon-dioxide-cause-global-warming/). Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes. Madelung's solid state physics book, for example calculates the rate of IR absorption, and you can calculate emission in an analogous way. His book might even do that derivation too, but I don't remember if it does since I read that section a while ago.

0x25fd;Okay, noted!
0x1974;I donâ€™t think youâ€™re all incorrect, I mean youâ€™ve pointed out a huge flaw in quantum. Essentially the Copenhagen representation is just a shut up and calculate model so itâ€™s difficult to comprehend conceptually. However, I do think you can view it as a probabilistic superposition for eigenstates, for example, the double slit experiment. If we observe the photons, then only go through one slit and we donâ€™t really see a defraction grating but if we leave the system unobserved we see the wave/particle duality. This is when the particle goes through both slits. Actually SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s cat was made by him as an example of how ridiculous the probabilistic approached QM isâ€¦but it actually is a good example which is ironic. I also like the quantum coin.

0x1ab3;Edit: I think Chill_Comet actually has the correct explanation. My idea might be plausible, but likely not right. \n\nThe candle is consuming the wax. Liquid wax is rising up from the surface into the wick to replace the wax being burned. It looks like that upward current by friction carries along a circulating current (rotating in the vertical plane) which that creates a torus of rolling wax that surrounds the wick. Those currents carry some of the small particles with it, which make the current visible. The changes in speed are neat. The current clearly gets compressed and therefore speeds up on the surface, but spreads out and slows down just below.

If you do this after allowing the UCN in the trap to decay for a short amount of time, and for a long amount of time, then you can map out the exponential decay curve and extract the lifetime. Repeat 5000 times for a high-precision measurement.\n\nThe difficult parts of the analysis are:\n\n* estimating how many UCN were in the trap at the beginning of each run (you canâ€™t count them directly because then the trap would be empty)\n\n* reconstructing neutrons from a collection of counts in the PMTs\n\n* understanding the backgrounds very well\n\n* putting this all together in a way that doesnâ€™t bias the extracted lifetime

The top and bottom quark for instance couple closely to the Higgs, since we measure their masses to be larger than the usual up/down quarks and leptons. If something is weird (not Standard Model like) with these couplings, then we can get a hint of new physics. If everything is as expected, then we just tick the boxes and are happy.

I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\n\nI agree.

(Sanofi, Merck and GSK.)\n\nTechnically I believe the vaccines are still in phase 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. But to add to that, even looking at the MINIMUM timelines for each phase, it's over 2 years. I'm not sure when exactly they started, but I dont think it was October 2019\n\n>I can't speak on this particular local doctor's experience or anything. But the adverse events of the vaccines are readily available for you to review.\n\nNow this is a tough one. Again it kind of goes back to personal experiences, but at the same time, this is all so new and so much data at coming in all at once, it would be next to impossible to determine ALL of the adverse effects. Adding to that, unless science have developed a time machine, long term effects, even though extremely unlikely would be exactly impossible to know."
0x2386;Neuroscience drug discovery is probably as close as you can get while including synthesis as a major component of the work. The problem is we understand so little about the brain that it's way harder than regular drug discovery, which is already very hard.\n\nOptogenetics and other chemical biology programs are probably the next best thing where chemistry is a tool to prove biological questions. Questions under investigation tend to be mapping neuronal responses to stimuli, understanding gene expression, things like that. The synthesis is usually going to be pretty straightforward since it's a means to an end.

For example, a lot of the compounds I acquire for lab work are 99.9% pure. That means for every 100 g of the compound, 0.1 g is contamination of things that aren't the compound I bought. \n\nPurity can relate to concentration, as your actual concentration will be slightly lower than your calculated concentration when preparing solutions.

0x27a3;You make some fair points, but Iâ€™m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we wonâ€™t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isnâ€™t what youâ€™re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as Iâ€™m aware, I donâ€™t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I donâ€™t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldnâ€™t be using fossil fuels for energy. Iâ€™m not a â€œclean coalâ€ or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. Itâ€™s not a fixed cost for every material. I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we arenâ€™t trying to â€œunburn the coal.â€ Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isnâ€™t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I donâ€™t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.

0x14d0;First off, when it comes to biology, there is no differentiatiation between mind and body, the mind is still governed by the body (the brain), and the constraints placed on it by nature. So there is no evolution of the mind without evolution of the body, and vice versa.\n\nSecondly, given that technology has been present in our lineage for less than 5% of our existence as a species/genus, without technology our bodies would be predominantly the same as they are now. The main difference I would expect is to see less elderly, less overweight people and less people with severe illnesses.

0x228b;I struggled in undergrad but really thrived in grad school.  For the coursework, I think it helped that is was more specialized material focused on my specific interests at the times.  Plus it was short, only five courses then on the research.  Things really opened up though once I got into independent research.  Iâ€™ve always liked to work with my hands and tinker, and I found an advisor who really did a good job encouraging us to go in the lab and figure things out on our own (how it should be).  For me the change in environment was very positive but I had classmates I saw who did very well in undergrad that struggled with the lack of structure.  So I guess to answer, Iâ€™d say no, undergrad was not a good indicator of grad school success.  However, doing well in undergrad can open up more options for where you go to grad school.

0x147;Short answer: no. \n\nLess short answer: ignoring air resistance, falling from 170m takes \~5.8 second and the object would be traveling around \~58 m/s ... slower than the speed of sound in air (so no shockwave). \n\nSpeculative answer: google says that 120 mph (53 m/s) winds can knock someone down. So something with a larger surface area might push enough air between itself and the ground to generate those sorts of local air flows (but being larger, it would be slower due to air resistance which I've not covered).

So logically, any plant, animal or fungus we consume must contain all twenty, but the proportions will differ a lot depending on which proteins a species makes a lot or a little of.
0x11d8;I believe vaccine is generally more effective. The first one tells your body to start making the spike protein that protects against COVID. Once you get the second vaccine, your body realizes â€œhey, Iâ€™ve seen this before, it must be importantâ€ and makes even more spike proteins for a more long-lasted â€œimmunityâ€ against COVID. Like plenty of others have said, nothing is going to be 100% effective, but that goes for all vaccines.

I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\n\nI agree.

But the endpoints and outcomes of the protocol were approved and the trial results met the efficacy and safety standards. None of which were altered because of COVID. These are done by independent review boards and have to declare no conflicts of interest. There has also been failed mRNA COVID vaccines too, but that's less in the news. (Sanofi, Merck and GSK.)\n\nTechnically I believe the vaccines are still in phase 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. But to add to that, even looking at the MINIMUM timelines for each phase, it's over 2 years. I'm not sure when exactly they started, but I dont think it was October 2019\n\n>I can't speak on this particular local doctor's experience or anything. But the adverse events of the vaccines are readily available for you to review.\n\nNow this is a tough one. Again it kind of goes back to personal experiences, but at the same time, this is all so new and so much data at coming in all at once, it would be next to impossible to determine ALL of the adverse effects. Adding to that, unless science have developed a time machine, long term effects, even though extremely unlikely would be exactly impossible to know."

But if you ask them what those objects in the sky were, they couldnâ€™t tell you because they didnâ€™t know. The more I learn about this topic the more I realize that not much has changed since Feynman gave that talk.

It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130Â°F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight"").

0x98b;"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""? Did this doctor actually designed a study and properly measured a correlation between a vaccination and all these diseases? And published it? If not, then his words don't mean anything."

0xcb4;1)  Youâ€™d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\n\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\n\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections.
0x20d4;I think the emergent property argument, at least as Iâ€™ve heard Sean Carroll say in other contexts, is something similar to how physicists view emergent properties in statistical mechanics. That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and weâ€™ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I donâ€™t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.

The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]"

0xaf3;"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine. People with weirder diets, like alcoholics, may need more protein heavy foods."

I have multiple oak trees on the street and have even made a lot of acorn mash.\n\nAfter having gathering multiple trash bags worth of good acorns, I can tell you \~1/3 of them are trash that you can filter right off that bat.  They're not ripe (trees don't drop unripe acorns that are good) or they're hollow (there's a wevile inside or there's mold) or they're too dark (mold).\n\nFurthermore, based on just watching squirrels, you realize they'll eat specific parts of the acorn that are likely less bitter (I think it was the tops, but it's been a year and we're getting back to acorn season).  When they find one they like, they'll bury them and pat them down.\n\nIf you feel like harvesting them, the next step is drying them.   Then put them in water and trashing the ones that float or the ones that have tiny holes in them (bugs).  Then you crack them open, trash bad ones, and crush them.  I soak them in a bowl and change the water at first 2-3x/day, and stop once I'm changing the water once every 3 days.  Basically go until you leech out most of the tannins and they're not bitter anymore.\n\nIn the end, \~1/2 the acorns you'd pick up and even consider are bad.

People have met other family members that they had never met in real life, describe them to living family members who confirmed identity with pictures.

Whether thereâ€™s something after this life or not, we DO have this tangible life right now and itâ€™s what we should put all our focus toward.

0x1027;Hey man, not sure why people are up in arms if this is truly not for a grade, which I hope it is not. OH proton signals are typically funky and broad because they exchange with solvent (they are somewhat acidic), so that statement is telling you the singlet belongs to the OH proton. The small signal at 78 ppm in the C NMR is from solvent if it was run in a chlorinated solvent, otherwise it may be from your analyte (what would make a C appear at higher ppm?) So now you can use the MW along with the fact you have a Cl and O to play around with some structures which match your H and C NMR.\n\nEdit: I'm certain the small peak in the C NMR is solvent, so ignore it. You should have been told the solvent it was run in. CDCl3 shows up around 77 ppm on C NMR.

With the mass spec having the molecular ion being at 96/98 m/z at a 3:1 ratio that shows there is a Cl in there because of cl-35 having \~75% abundance and cl-37 about 25%.  \n  \nIm confused about the last statement in the problem because we haven't seen other problems like that. The C NMR shows that there are 3 unique CSP3 carbons, not sure what the small peak at \~78 is showing. And then in the H NMR there is 4 peaks and i understand the N+1 for the amount of peaks in 1 overall peak. Im just trying to figure out the structure... im under the assumption rn that the molecular formula is C3H9OCl"

It connects to the baby via the umbilical cord in order to allow nutrient transport, waste excretion and gas exchange between mother and baby.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/biology/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)
0x84a;I believe you but can they perch with their legs if not than how do they perch?
0x1b46;We are ordering a PLM at work to streamline our crystallinity studies and I. am. psyched. to be looking at images like this every week!
0x17ef;My understanding is that the COVID vaccine creates a targeted protein found on most if not all variants for your immune system to build defenses against. Natural immunity may or may not target the same protein so it could be more effective against the strain you were infected with but not others. Getting COVID after getting the vaccine reinforces the already built defenses so it may provide slightly stronger defense against future infection.
0x192f;Can you check if [this](https://twitter.com/leuxri/status/1453085434871910402?s=21) is the correct formula for bromite and its elementsâ€™ oxidation number? Thank you!
0x246e;Itâ€™s not possible to extract useful energy from a particular temperature unless you can get a temperature differential, per thermodynamics.  Even if you can get a temperature differential, then youâ€™ll necessarily be equalizing the temperatures of the two systems, so you wouldnâ€™t be able to have any net cooling.  (You can think of this as extracting some energy from the potential between the two systems rather than the actual kinetic energies of the atoms)
0xda0;What do they predict?
0x27b9;Water marks from where it dried when you cleaned it?
0x249;Their lifespan is a mere 24 hours, and although they have six legs they cannot walk
0x76a;There were planes dropping a killing chemical in summer during 3 years because they are very persistent and the eggs can survive quit long\n\nBut when we found some my grandfather took them with a shovel and put them in a fire\n\nMaybe you should tell a local wildlife departure or someone like that, they should know what to do
0x6d9;that won't do.
0x168e;Excellent example to illustrate the difference!!
0x1db5;Itâ€™s a stretch, but fight club talks about soap and explosives.
0x17e5;is molar mass the same as wight of air
0x136a;That's so cool :D
0x18ca;Calcium carbide?
0x2792;Another example: Federal Reserve spends more on buying Apple bonds than the combined research funding of all physics departments in the world combined. Science is an increasingly difficult pursuit in this crazy world where Fed prints money like crazy.
0xda2;Thank you!
0xcb6;Looks like degraded rubber from chemicals in your toilet. If it is leaking, buy a new flapper and stop using those chemicals.

0x15de;Ooh.  Control L - good trick!
0x1a47;i have same problem, help whats the solution :(
0x791;iâ€™m also really good at statistics, but not calculus. does that correlate as well?
0x474;You have the stats to prove that? My stats come directly from the CDC website so letâ€™s not try and discredit what Iâ€™m saying here.
0x7e4;uwu
0x19f8;The heat would have to come from a chemical reaction, basically ice/snow/water + reactant has more potential energy than the product.  When the reaction happens, the new compound gives off energy in the form of heat
0x1853;Does it make the toaster dance?
0x2453;Iâ€™d go further and call it bs. These are not the relativistic form of Maxwell eqs. The vectors are 3d. A 4d divergence on a 3d vector? Not so sure that that makes sense. \n\nMaybe Iâ€™m wrong
0x1753;Thereâ€™s no room for humor in physics apparently.
0xba5;Nice
0x1a9;Itâ€™s a kind of magic
0x27b1;"People with ""raging curiosity"" go far in life. Good for you and good luck."

0xf74;Thank you for your kindness <3 Found this [injured dragon fly](https://news.yahoo.com/news/blogs/sideshow/handfeeding-injured-dragonfly-180758521.html)
0x1c7c;"Are you wanting this to be a ""peel off"" mask? If so, probably going to need the PVA."
0x187;Try to understand everything you do in the lab, as well as to not underestimate quality documentation
0x133;First off, matter can absolutely be created and destroyed. Just not at standard conditions. This is part of what high energy physics deals with. For example, there was a recent experiment at the LHC where photons (massless particles) were merged into bosons (massive particles).\n\nYou are asking about the [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle). Inorganic carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, is extracted from the environment, reduced and fixed into organic matter primarily through photosynthesis. Cells do this by harnessing an enthalpy gradient to lower entropy.\n\nIf you are asking where all the carbon on Earth comes from - it was generated in stars on the main sequence, from hydrogen, via [nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis). We have a fixed and constant amount of carbon.
0x262;Thank You - If I assumed it was an electric heater, what would the formula be?\n\nYou are correct, and though this is a sealed propane fireplace, the 50,000BTU of the burner, looses 32% of itâ€™s efficiency due to the chimney.\n\nAlso the reason for the question is I have a â€˜newâ€™ fireplace installed, that is higher BTU than the old, yet yields no  heat. The manufacture and installer and distributer all were over today, filling the air with techno-garbo of why I should expect a 50,000 BTU fireplace to NOT HEAT A ROOM very well.\n\nI did the math 50,000x68%=34,000 BTU actual heat. Now to demonstrate the lack of heat, I converted this to Watts then showed a 1500watt electric heater was hotter than the fireplace. \n\nWhat I would like to show a theoretical heat transfer in temperature gain.\n\nThanks agin for the time
0x1e02;I make similar observations over the last weeks (southern Germany) \nWasps seem to crave for energy / sugar because natural resources are running out because of the season. I guess within some days or weeks, wasps will beginn to hibernate/ die and problem of overly active ones is solved.
0xc8d;You would know.
0x723;Also use the correct number of sig figs
0x667;What about the ethical delimmas,  groundbreaking technology, and future research in the field of genetic engineering. Is it safe? What are the strengths?. What are the benefits and whereare we headed? Amongst different cultural and spiritual dynamics, where do we draw the line when it comes to a want and a need? What risks are present and possible for the future of the field?
0x1476;I would like to know too.
